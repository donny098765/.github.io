        Hi, my name is Donny Yang, a passionate and driven student currently enrolled in the web development program at Fox Valley Technical College (FVTC). With a keen interest in the ever-evolving world of technology, I'm on on a journey to become a skilled front-end developer.

    Beyond the realm of coding, I am a avid gamer who enjoys both video and board games, finding joy in the immersive experiences they offer. When not immersed in the digital world, I'm equally at home on the sports field, engaging in various athletic activities that keep both mind and body active.

    An enthusiast for knowledge and diverse perspectives, I also spend time listening to podcasts, broadening horizons and staying informed about the latest trends in technology and beyond. The love for nature and adventure takes me to the great outdoors, where hiking becomes a cherished escape.

    With a dream to not only be a front-end developer but also to explore the world of freelancing, I hope to learn and stay committed to honing my skills and contributing to the dynamic landscape of web development.
